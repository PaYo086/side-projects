            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">DNA has been the predominant information storage medium for biology and holds great promise as a next-generation high-density data medium in the digital era. Currently, the vast majority of DNA-based data storage approaches rely on in vitro DNA synthesis. As such, there are limited methods to encode digital data into the chromosomes of living cells in a single step. Here, we describe a new electrogenetic framework for direct storage of digital data in living cells. Using an engineered redox-responsive CRISPR adaptation system, we encoded binary data in 3-bit units into CRISPR arrays of bacterial cells by electrical stimulation. We demonstrate multiplex data encoding into barcoded cell populations to yield meaningful information storage and capacity up to 72 bits, which can be maintained over many generations in natural open environments. This work establishes a direct digital-to-biological data storage framework and advances our capacity for information exchange between silicon- and carbon-based entities.

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">The complexity and inter-related nature of biological data poses a difficult challenge for data and tool integration. There has been a proliferation of interoperability standards and projects over the past decade, none of which has been widely adopted by the bioinformatics community. Recent attempts have focused on the use of semantics to assist integration, and Semantic Web technologies are being welcomed by this community.Description.SADI – Semantic Automated Discovery and Integration – is a lightweight set of fully standards-compliant Semantic Web service design patterns that simplify the publication of services of the type commonly found in bioinformatics and other scientific domains. Using Semantic Web technologies at every level of the Web services “stack”, SADI services consume and produce instances of OWL Classes following a small number of very straightforward best-practices. In addition, we provide codebases that support these best-practices, and plug-in tools to popular developer and client software that dramatically simplify deployment of services by providers, and the discovery and utilization of those services by their consumers. SADI Services are fully compliant with, and utilize only foundational Web standards; are simple to create and maintain for service providers; and can be discovered and utilized in a very intuitive way by biologist end-users. In addition, the SADI design patterns significantly improve the ability of software to automatically discover appropriate services based on user-needs, and automatically chain these into complex analytical workflows. We show that, when resources are exposed through SADI, data compliant with a given ontological model can be automatically gathered, or generated, from these distributed, non-coordinating resources - a behavior we have not observed in any other Semantic system. Finally, we show that, using SADI, data dynamically generated from Web services can be explored in a manner very similar to data housed in static triple-stores, thus facilitating the intersection of Web services and Semantic Web technologies.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">Holography is a promising technology for photo-realistic three-dimensional (3D) displays because of its ability to replay the light reflected from an object using a spatial light modulator (SLM). However, the enormous computational requirements for calculating computer-generated holograms (CGHs)—which are displayed on an SLM as a diffraction pattern—are a significant problem for practical uses (e.g., for interactive 3D displays for remote navigation systems). Here, we demonstrate an interactive 3D display system using electro-holography that can operate with a consumer’s CPU. The proposed system integrates an efficient and fast CGH computation algorithm for line-drawn 3D objects with inter-frame differencing, so that the trajectory of a line-drawn object that is handwritten on a drawing tablet can be played back interactively using only the CPU. In this system, we used an SLM with 1,920

               1,080 pixels and a pixel pitch of 8 μm × 8 μm, a drawing tablet as an interface, and an Intel Core i9–9900K 3.60 GHz CPU. Numerical and optical experiments using a dataset of handwritten inputs show that the proposed system is capable of reproducing handwritten 3D images in real time with sufficient interactivity and image quality.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">We form very rapid personality impressions about speakers on hearing a single word. This implies that the acoustical properties of the voice (e.g., pitch) are very powerful cues when forming social impressions. Here, we aimed to explore how personality impressions for brief social utterances transfer across languages and whether acoustical properties play a similar role in driving personality impressions. Additionally, we examined whether evaluations are similar in the native and a foreign language of the listener. In two experiments we asked Spanish listeners to evaluate personality traits from different instances of the Spanish word “Hola” (Experiment 1) and the English word “Hello” (Experiment 2), native and foreign language respectively. The results revealed that listeners across languages form very similar personality impressions irrespective of whether the voices belong to the native or the foreign language of the listener. A social voice space was summarized by two main personality traits, one emphasizing valence (e.g., trust) and the other strength (e.g., dominance). Conversely, the acoustical properties that listeners pay attention to when judging other’s personality vary across languages. These results provide evidence that social voice perception contains certain elements invariant across cultures/languages, while others are modulated by the cultural/linguistic background of the listener.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">Two thirds of the surface of our planet are covered by water and are still poorly instrumented, which has prevented the earth science community from addressing numerous key scientific questions. The potential to leverage the existing fiber optic seafloor telecom cables that criss-cross the oceans, by using them as dense arrays of seismo-acoustic sensors, remains to be evaluated. Here, we report Distributed Acoustic Sensing measurements on a 41.5 km-long telecom cable that is deployed offshore Toulon, France. Our observations demonstrate the capability to monitor with unprecedented details the ocean-solid earth interactions from the coast to the abyssal plain, in addition to regional seismicity (e.g., a magnitude 1.9 micro-earthquake located 100 km away) with signal characteristics comparable to those of a coastal seismic station. Existing fibers beneath the world’s oceans can in principle be used as seismic sensors, but the full potential of this possibility has yet to be explored. Here, the authors demonstrate the feasibility of distributed acoustic sensing in a coastal fiber as a sensor for earthquakes and wave phenomena.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">Nanoscale lithography and information storage in biocompatible materials offer possibilities for applications such as bioelectronics and degradable electronics for which traditional semiconductor fabrication techniques cannot be used. Silk fibroin, a natural protein renowned for its strength and biocompatibility, has been widely studied in this context. Here, we present the use of silk film as a biofunctional medium for nanolithography and data storage. Using tip-enhanced near-field infrared nanolithography, we demonstrate versatile manipulation and characterize the topography and conformation of the silk in situ. In particular, we fabricate greyscale and dual-tone nanopatterns with full-width at half-maximum resolutions of ~35 nm, creating an erasable ‘silk drive’ that digital data can be written to or read from. As an optical storage medium, the silk drive can store digital and biological information with a capacity of ~64 GB inch−2 and exhibits long-term stability under various harsh conditions. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we show that this silk drive can be biofunctionalized to exhibit chromogenic reactions, resistance to bacterial infection and heat-triggered, enzyme-assisted decomposition. A silk drive can store digital and biological information with a capacity of about 64 GB inch−2.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">We launched an array of nine freely floating submarine seismometers near the Galápagos islands, which remained operational for about two years. P and PKP waves from regional and teleseismic earthquakes were observed for a range of magnitudes. The signal-to-noise ratio is strongly influenced by the weather conditions and this determines the lowest magnitudes that can be observed. Waves from deep earthquakes are easier to pick, but the S/N ratio can be enhanced through filtering and the data cover earthquakes from all depths. We measured 580 arrival times for different raypaths. We show that even such a limited number of data gives a significant increase in resolution for the oceanic upper mantle. This is the first time an array of floating seismometers is used in seismic tomography to improve the resolution significantly where otherwise no seismic information is available. We show that the Galápagos Archipelago is underlain by a deep (about 1900 km) 200–300 km wide plume of high temperature, with a heat flux very much larger than predicted from its swell bathymetry. The decrease of the plume temperature anomaly towards the surface indicates that the Earth’s mantle has a subadiabatic temperature gradient.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">Throat cancer treatment involves surgical removal of the tumor, leaving patients with facial disfigurement as well as temporary or permanent loss of voice. Surface electromyography (sEMG) generated from the jaw contains lots of voice information. However, it is difficult to record because of not only the weakness of the signals but also the steep skin curvature. This paper demonstrates the design of an imperceptible, flexible epidermal sEMG tattoo-like patch with the thickness of less than 10 μm and peeling strength of larger than 1 N cm−1 that exhibits large adhesiveness to complex biological surfaces and is thus capable of sEMG recording for silent speech recognition. When a tester speaks silently, the patch shows excellent performance in recording the sEMG signals from three muscle channels and recognizing those frequently used instructions with high accuracy by using the wavelet decomposition and pattern recognization. The average accuracy of action instructions can reach up to 89.04%, and the average accuracy of emotion instructions is as high as 92.33%. To demonstrate the functionality of tattoo-like patches as a new human–machine interface (HMI) for patients with loss of voice, the intelligent silent speech recognition, voice synthesis, and virtual interaction have been implemented, which are of great importance in helping these patients communicate with people and make life more enjoyable. Tattoo-like wearable electronic patches could help patients who have lost the capacity for speech to communicate once again. The aftermath of surgeries for mouth and throat cancers can result in permanent voice loss, but the information needed to decode speech can still be recovered from the movements of facial muscles. Researchers led by Hongmiao Zhang and Lining Sun at China’s Soochow University and Chengkuo Lee at the National University of Singapore have developed flexible sensors that can be applied to the skin to capture this information. In a series of tests with human volunteers, they demonstrated that vocalization-associated muscle activity collected from these patches could be computationally decoded with up to 92% accuracy. Similar devices could eventually be coupled to voice synthesizers or other devices to help restore normal speech after cancer surgery.

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">The astronomical event GW170817, detected in gravitational and electromagnetic waves, is used to determine the expansion rate of the Universe, which is consistent with and independent of existing measurements. The gravitational-wave signature of merging black holes or neutron stars yields the distance to the merger. If a counterpart is observed and its recession velocity arising from the Hubble flow is known, then a calibration of the Hubble constant that is entirely independent of the usual 'distance ladder' is possible. The gravitational-wave event of 17 August 2017 (GW170817) corresponded to the merger of two neutron stars, and an associated 'kilonova' was seen. Daniel Holz and the LIGO–Virgo collaboration, along with a group of astronomers involved with the search for the counterpart, have determined that the Hubble constant calculated this way is about 70 kilometres per second per megaparsec. This is consistent with other determinations, but independent of them. On 17 August 2017, the Advanced LIGO1 and Virgo2 detectors observed the gravitational-wave event GW170817—a strong signal from the merger of a binary neutron-star system3. Less than two seconds after the merger, a γ-ray burst (GRB 170817A) was detected within a region of the sky consistent with the LIGO–Virgo-derived location of the gravitational-wave source4,5,6. This sky region was subsequently observed by optical astronomy facilities7, resulting in the identification8,9,10,11,12,13 of an optical transient signal within about ten arcseconds of the galaxy NGC 4993. This detection of GW170817 in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves represents the first ‘multi-messenger’ astronomical observation. Such observations enable GW170817 to be used as a ‘standard siren’14,15,16,17,18 (meaning that the absolute distance to the source can be determined directly from the gravitational-wave measurements) to measure the Hubble constant. This quantity represents the local expansion rate of the Universe, sets the overall scale of the Universe and is of fundamental importance to cosmology. Here we report a measurement of the Hubble constant that combines the distance to the source inferred purely from the gravitational-wave signal with the recession velocity inferred from measurements of the redshift using the electromagnetic data. In contrast to previous measurements, ours does not require the use of a cosmic ‘distance ladder’19: the gravitational-wave analysis can be used to estimate the luminosity distance out to cosmological scales directly, without the use of intermediate astronomical distance measurements. We determine the Hubble constant to be about 70 kilometres per second per megaparsec. This value is consistent with existing measurements20,21, while being completely independent of them. Additional standard siren measurements from future gravitational-wave sources will enable the Hubble constant to be constrained to high precision.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">Despite dedicated research has been carried out to adequately map the distribution of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean Sea, unlike other regions of the world, the species population status is still presently uncertain. The analysis of two years of continuous acoustic data provided by the ANTARES neutrino telescope revealed the year-round presence of sperm whales in the Ligurian Sea, probably associated with the availability of cephalopods in the region. The presence of the Ligurian Sea sperm whales was demonstrated through the real-time analysis of audio data streamed from a cabled-to-shore deep-sea observatory that allowed the hourly tracking of their long-range echolocation behaviour on the Internet. Interestingly, the same acoustic analysis indicated that the occurrence of surface shipping noise would apparently not condition the foraging behaviour of the sperm whale in the area, since shipping noise was almost always present when sperm whales were acoustically detected. The continuous presence of the sperm whale in the region confirms the ecological value of the Ligurian sea and the importance of ANTARES to help monitoring its ecosystems.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">Ocular antigens are sequestered behind the blood-retina barrier and the ocular environment protects ocular tissues from autoimmune attack. The signals required to activate autoreactive T cells and allow them to cause disease in the eye remain in part unclear. In particular, the consequences of peripheral presentation of ocular antigens are not fully understood. We examined peripheral expression and presentation of ocular neo-self-antigen in transgenic mice expressing hen egg lysozyme (HEL) under a retina-specific promoter. High levels of HEL were expressed in the eye compared to low expression throughout the lymphoid system. Adoptively transferred naïve HEL-specific CD4+ T cells proliferated in the eye draining lymph nodes, but did not induce uveitis. By contrast, systemic infection with a murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) engineered to express HEL induced extensive proliferation of transferred naïve CD4+ T cells, and significant uveoretinitis. In this model, wild-type MCMV, lacking HEL, did not induce overt uveitis, suggesting that disease is mediated by antigen-specific peripherally activated CD4+ T cells that infiltrate the retina. Our results demonstrate that retinal antigen is presented to T cells in the periphery under physiological conditions. However, when the same antigen is presented during viral infection, antigen-specific T cells access the retina and autoimmune uveitis ensues.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">Nicholas Feasey and colleagues report whole-genome sequence analysis of 675 isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis from 45 countries. They find evidence for a global epidemic clade associated with enterocolitis and two novel clades restricted to distinct regions of Africa and associated with invasive disease. An epidemiological paradox surrounds Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis. In high-income settings, it has been responsible for an epidemic of poultry-associated, self-limiting enterocolitis, whereas in sub-Saharan Africa it is a major cause of invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella disease, associated with high case fatality. By whole-genome sequence analysis of 675 isolates of S. Enteritidis from 45 countries, we show the existence of a global epidemic clade and two new clades of S. Enteritidis that are geographically restricted to distinct regions of Africa. The African isolates display genomic degradation, a novel prophage repertoire, and an expanded multidrug resistance plasmid. S. Enteritidis is a further example of a Salmonella serotype that displays niche plasticity, with distinct clades that enable it to become a prominent cause of gastroenteritis in association with the industrial production of eggs and of multidrug-resistant, bloodstream-invasive infection in Africa.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">Together with plague, smallpox and typhus, epidemics of dysentery have been a major scourge of human populations for centuries1. A previous genomic study concluded that Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (Sd1), the epidemic dysentery bacillus, emerged and spread worldwide after the First World War, with no clear pattern of transmission2. This is not consistent with the massive cyclic dysentery epidemics reported in Europe during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries1,3,4 and the first isolation of Sd1 in Japan in 18975. Here, we report a whole-genome analysis of 331 Sd1 isolates from around the world, collected between 1915 and 2011, providing us with unprecedented insight into the historical spread of this pathogen. We show here that Sd1 has existed since at least the eighteenth century and that it swept the globe at the end of the nineteenth century, diversifying into distinct lineages associated with the First World War, Second World War and various conflicts or natural disasters across Africa, Asia and Central America. We also provide a unique historical perspective on the evolution of antibiotic resistance over a 100-year period, beginning decades before the antibiotic era, and identify a prevalent multiple antibiotic-resistant lineage in South Asia that was transmitted in several waves to Africa, where it caused severe outbreaks of disease. Global phylogenetic analyses of Shigella dysenteriae isolates uncover the transcontinental transmission events and evolution of antibiotic resistance behind the major dysentery epidemics in the modern era.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">The environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei causes an estimated 165,000 cases of human melioidosis per year worldwide and is also classified as a biothreat agent. We used whole genome sequences of 469 B. pseudomallei isolates from 30 countries collected over 79 years to explore its geographic transmission. Our data point to Australia as an early reservoir, with transmission to Southeast Asia followed by onward transmission to South Asia and East Asia. Repeated reintroductions were observed within the Malay Peninsula and between countries bordered by the Mekong River. Our data support an African origin of the Central and South American isolates with introduction of B. pseudomallei into the Americas between 1650 and 1850, providing a temporal link with the slave trade. We also identified geographically distinct genes/variants in Australasian or Southeast Asian isolates alone, with virulence-associated genes being among those over-represented. This provides a potential explanation for clinical manifestations of melioidosis that are geographically restricted. Whole genome sequencing provides a picture of Burkholderia pseudomallei dissemination and evolution.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">The population of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), the causative agent of typhoid fever, exhibits limited DNA sequence variation, which complicates efforts to rationally discriminate individual isolates. Here we utilize data from whole-genome sequences (WGS) of nearly 2,000 isolates sourced from over 60 countries to generate a robust genotyping scheme that is phylogenetically informative and compatible with a range of assays. These data show that, with the exception of the rapidly disseminating H58 subclade (now designated genotype 4.3.1), the global S. Typhi population is highly structured and includes dozens of subclades that display geographical restriction. The genotyping approach presented here can be used to interrogate local S. Typhi populations and help identify recent introductions of S. Typhi into new or previously endemic locations, providing information on their likely geographical source. This approach can be used to classify clinical isolates and provides a universal framework for further experimental investigations. Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi). This study examines ∼2,000 clinical isolates of S. Typhi to show highly structured/geographically restricted genomes except rapidly disseminating H58 subclade, and design a genotyping framework for tracking the disease.

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">Using infrared wavelengths, micrometre-sized water-ice grains have been identified on the nucleus (which is mostly coated in a dark material) of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. Until now there has been little evidence for the presence of large regions of exposed water ice on the surfaces of comets, despite the fact that water is the major constituent of cometary nuclei. Here Gianrico Filacchione et al. report the identification at infrared wavelengths of water ice in the form of millimetre-sized grains on two debris falls in the Imhotep region of the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, based on data from the VIRTIS imaging spectrometer onboard ESA's Rosetta probe. The ice is exposed on the walls of elevated structures and at the base of the walls, and is best explained by grain growth by vapour diffusion in ice-rich layers, or by sintering. As a consequence of these processes, the nucleus can develop an extended and complex layering in which the outer dehydrated crust is superimposed on water ice enriched layers. Although water vapour is the main species observed in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko1,2 and water is the major constituent of cometary nuclei3,4, limited evidence for exposed water-ice regions on the surface of the nucleus has been found so far5,6. The absence of large regions of exposed water ice seems a common finding on the surfaces of many of the comets observed so far7,8,9. The nucleus of 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko appears to be fairly uniformly coated with dark, dehydrated, refractory and organic-rich material10. Here we report the identification at infrared wavelengths of water ice on two debris falls in the Imhotep region of the nucleus. The ice has been exposed on the walls of elevated structures and at the base of the walls. A quantitative derivation of the abundance of ice in these regions indicates the presence of millimetre-sized pure water-ice grains, considerably larger than in all previous observations6,7,8,9. Although micrometre-sized water-ice grains are the usual result of vapour recondensation in ice-free layers6, the occurrence of millimetre-sized grains of pure ice as observed in the Imhotep debris falls is best explained by grain growth by vapour diffusion in ice-rich layers, or by sintering. As a consequence of these processes, the nucleus can develop an extended and complex coating in which the outer dehydrated crust10 is superimposed on layers enriched in water ice. The stratigraphy observed on 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko11,12 is therefore the result of evolutionary processes affecting the uppermost metres of the nucleus and does not necessarily require a global layering to have occurred at the time of the comet’s formation.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">Our understanding of the internal dynamics of the Earth is largely based on images of seismic velocity variations in the mantle obtained with global tomography. However, our ability to image the mantle is severely hampered by a lack of seismic data collected in marine areas. Here we report observations made under different noise conditions (in the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian and Pacific Oceans) by a submarine floating seismograph, and show that such floats are able to fill the oceanic data gap. Depending on the ambient noise level, the floats can record between 35 and 63% of distant earthquakes with a moment magnitude M≥6.5. Even magnitudes <6.0 can be successfully observed under favourable noise conditions. The serendipitous recording of an earthquake swarm near the Indian Ocean triple junction enabled us to establish a threshold magnitude between 2.7 and 3.4 for local earthquakes in the noisiest of the three environments. Our understanding of the internal dynamics of the Earth is limited by the lack of seismic data available from oceanic domains. Here, the authors use observations from floating submarine seismographs to show that this technique may provide seismic data to fill the gaps in our knowledge.

            <font size="4">Observations of water ice on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko show the ice appearing and disappearing in a cyclic pattern that follows local illumination conditions, providing a source of localized activity and leading to cycling modification of the ice abundance on the surface. Maria Cristina De Sanctis et al. report observations from the VIRTIS imaging spectrometer onboard the Rosetta mission that show a diurnal water ice on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov–-Gerasimenko. Surface water ice appears and disappears in a cyclic pattern that follows local illumination conditions, providing a source of localized activity. The authors suggest that the cyclic sublimation–condensation of ice triggered by varying illumination conditions may be a general process acting on cometary nuclei. Observations of cometary nuclei have revealed a very limited amount of surface water ice1,2,3,4,5,6,7, which is insufficient to explain the observed water outgassing. This was clearly demonstrated on comet 9P/Tempel 1, where the dust jets (driven by volatiles) were only partially correlated with the exposed ice regions8. The observations6,7 of 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko have revealed that activity has a diurnal variation in intensity arising from changing insolation conditions. It was previously concluded that water vapour was generated in ice-rich subsurface layers with a transport mechanism linked to solar illumination1,2,3,5, but that has not hitherto been observed. Periodic condensations of water vapour very close to, or on, the surface were suggested3,9 to explain short-lived outbursts seen near sunrise on comet 9P/Tempel 1. Here we report observations of water ice on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, appearing and disappearing in a cyclic pattern that follows local illumination conditions, providing a source of localized activity. This water cycle appears to be an important process in the evolution of the comet, leading to cyclical modification of the relative abundance of water ice on its surface.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">The general theory of relativity predicts that all accelerating objects produce gravitational waves — analogous to electromagnetic waves — that should be detectable for instance in the case of extremely massive objects such as black holes undergoing acceleration. The existence of such waves has been inferred indirectly, but an important goal in physics is their direct observation, a feat that would both validate Einstein's theory and lead to new areas of cosmology. Now early results from LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory), one of the handful of detectors searching for gravity waves, have provided a starting point for further gravity hunts by deriving an upper limit for the stochastic background of gravitational waves of cosmological origin. The data rule out models of early Universe evolution with a relatively large equation-of-state parameter, as well as cosmic (super)string models with relatively small string tension that are favoured in some string theory models. A stochastic background of gravitational waves is expected to arise from a superposition of a large number of unresolved gravitational-wave sources and should carry unique signatures from the earliest epochs of the Universe. Limits on the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational-wave background are now reported using the data from a two-year science run of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. These limits rule out certain models of early Universe evolution. A stochastic background of gravitational waves is expected to arise from a superposition of a large number of unresolved gravitational-wave sources of astrophysical and cosmological origin. It should carry unique signatures from the earliest epochs in the evolution of the Universe, inaccessible to standard astrophysical observations1. Direct measurements of the amplitude of this background are therefore of fundamental importance for understanding the evolution of the Universe when it was younger than one minute. Here we report limits on the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational-wave background using the data from a two-year science run of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory2 (LIGO). Our result constrains the energy density of the stochastic gravitational-wave background normalized by the critical energy density of the Universe, in the frequency band around 100 Hz, to be <6.9 × 10-6 at 95% confidence. The data rule out models of early Universe evolution with relatively large equation-of-state parameter3, as well as cosmic (super)string models with relatively small string tension4 that are favoured in some string theory models5. This search for the stochastic background improves on the indirect limits from Big Bang nucleosynthesis1,6 and cosmic microwave background7 at 100 Hz.</font>

            <font size="4">ESA's Venus Express probe has been in orbit since April 2006. Eight research papers in this issue present new results from the mission, covering the atmosphere, polar features, interactions with the solar wind and the controversial matter of venusian lightning.

Andrew Ingersoll considers the latest results, and also how the project teams plan to make the most of the probe's remaining six years of life. Observations of infrared emission from CO2, O2 and NO established that photochemical and dynamic activity controls the structure of the upper atmosphere of Venus, but were unable to identify the altitude of the emission. But it is reported here that day-side CO2 emission extends from 90–120 km altitude, with a peak at ∼115 km. Night-side O2 emission peaks at 96 km and is visible over the range 95–100 km. The upper atmosphere of a planet is a transition region in which energy is transferred between the deeper atmosphere and outer space. Molecular emissions from the upper atmosphere (90–120 km altitude) of Venus can be used to investigate the energetics and to trace the circulation of this hitherto little-studied region. Previous spacecraft1 and ground-based2,3,4 observations of infrared emission from CO2, O2 and NO have established that photochemical and dynamic activity controls the structure of the upper atmosphere of Venus. These data, however, have left unresolved the precise altitude of the emission1 owing to a lack of data and of an adequate observing geometry5,6. Here we report measurements of day-side CO2 non-local thermodynamic equilibrium emission at 4.3 µm, extending from 90 to 120 km altitude, and of night-side O2 emission extending from 95 to 100 km. The CO2 emission peak occurs at ∼115 km and varies with solar zenith angle over a range of ∼10 km. This confirms previous modelling7, and permits the beginning of a systematic study of the variability of the emission. The O2 peak emission happens at 96 km ± 1 km, which is consistent with three-body recombination of oxygen atoms transported from the day side by a global thermospheric sub-solar to anti-solar circulation, as previously predicted8.</font>

Andrew Ingersoll considers the latest results, and also how the project teams plan to make the most of the probe's remaining six years of life. Venus has a bright 'dipole' double-eye feature at the centre of a vast vortex that rotates around the north pole, and is surrounded by a cold 'collar'. Observations of Venus' south polar region are reported, where clouds with morphology much like those around the north pole are seen, but rotating somewhat faster. Venus has no seasons, slow rotation and a very massive atmosphere, which is mainly carbon dioxide with clouds primarily of sulphuric acid droplets. Infrared observations by previous missions to Venus revealed a bright ‘dipole’ feature surrounded by a cold ‘collar’ at its north pole1,2,3,4. The polar dipole is a ‘double-eye’ feature at the centre of a vast vortex that rotates around the pole, and is possibly associated with rapid downwelling. The polar cold collar is a wide, shallow river of cold air that circulates around the polar vortex. One outstanding question has been whether the global circulation was symmetric, such that a dipole feature existed at the south pole. Here we report observations of Venus’ south-polar region, where we have seen clouds with morphology much like those around the north pole, but rotating somewhat faster than the northern dipole. The vortex may extend down to the lower cloud layers that lie at about 50 km height and perhaps deeper. The spectroscopic properties of the clouds around the south pole are compatible with a sulphuric acid composition.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">Infants’ preference for faces with direct compared to averted eye gaze, and for infant-directed over adult-directed speech, reflects early sensitivity to social communication. Here, we studied whether infant-directed speech (IDS), could affect the processing of a face with direct gaze in 4-month-olds. In a new ERP paradigm, the word ‘hello’ was uttered either in IDS or adult-direct speech (ADS) followed by an upright or inverted face. We show that the face-specific N290 ERP component was larger when faces were preceded by IDS relative to ADS. Crucially, this effect is specific to upright faces, whereas inverted faces preceded by IDS elicited larger attention-related P1 and Nc. These results suggest that IDS generates communicative expectations in infants. When such expectations are met by a following social stimulus – an upright face – infants are already prepared to process it. When the stimulus is a non-social one –inverted face – IDS merely increases general attention.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">When perceptually available information is scant, we can leverage logical connections among hypotheses to draw reliable conclusions that guide our reasoning and learning. We investigate whether this function of logical reasoning is present in infancy and aid understanding and learning about the social environment. In our task, infants watch reaching actions directed toward a hidden object whose identity is ambiguous between two alternatives and has to be inferred by elimination. Here we show that infants apply a disjunctive inference to identify the hidden object and use this logical conclusion to assess the consistency of the actions with a preference previously demonstrated by the agent and, importantly, also to acquire new knowledge regarding the preferences of the observed actor. These findings suggest that, early in life, preverbal logical reasoning functions as a reliable source of evidence that can support learning by offering a logical route for knowledge acquisition. When data is scant, logical reasoning can lead to knowledge acquisition by disclosing evidence otherwise not available. Here, the authors show that this logical route to knowledge is available to preverbal infants and can help them learn about the social world.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">Studies in human genetics deal with a plethora of human genome sequencing data that are generated from specimens as well as available on public domains. With the development of various bioinformatics applications, maintaining the productivity of research, managing human genome data, and analyzing downstream data is essential. This review aims to guide struggling researchers to process and analyze these large-scale genomic data to extract relevant information for improved downstream analyses. Here, we discuss worldwide human genome projects that could be integrated into any data for improved analysis. Obtaining human whole-genome sequencing data from both data stores and processes is costly; therefore, we focus on the development of data format and software that manipulate whole-genome sequencing. Once the sequencing is complete and its format and data processing tools are selected, a computational platform is required. For the platform, we describe a multi-cloud strategy that balances between cost, performance, and customizability. A good quality published research relies on data reproducibility to ensure quality results, reusability for applications to other datasets, as well as scalability for the future increase of datasets. To solve these, we describe several key technologies developed in computer science, including workflow engine. We also discuss the ethical guidelines inevitable for human genomic data analysis that differ from model organisms. Finally, the future ideal perspective of data processing and analysis is summarized.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">Electronics is approaching a major paradigm shift because silicon transistor scaling no longer yields historical energy-efficiency benefits, spurring research towards beyond-silicon nanotechnologies. In particular, carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNFET)-based digital circuits promise substantial energy-efficiency benefits, but the inability to perfectly control intrinsic nanoscale defects and variability in carbon nanotubes has precluded the realization of very-large-scale integrated systems. Here we overcome these challenges to demonstrate a beyond-silicon microprocessor built entirely from CNFETs. This 16-bit microprocessor is based on the RISC-V instruction set, runs standard 32-bit instructions on 16-bit data and addresses, comprises more than 14,000 complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor CNFETs and is designed and fabricated using industry-standard design flows and processes. We propose a manufacturing methodology for carbon nanotubes, a set of combined processing and design techniques for overcoming nanoscale imperfections at macroscopic scales across full wafer substrates. This work experimentally validates a promising path towards practical beyond-silicon electronic systems. A 16-bit microprocessor built from over 14,000 carbon nanotube transistors may enable energy efficiency advances in electronics technologies beyond silicon.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">DNA is an emerging medium for digital data and its adoption can be accelerated by synthesis processes specialized for storage applications. Here, we describe a de novo enzymatic synthesis strategy designed for data storage which harnesses the template-independent polymerase terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) in kinetically controlled conditions. Information is stored in transitions between non-identical nucleotides of DNA strands. To produce strands representing user-defined content, nucleotide substrates are added iteratively, yielding short homopolymeric extensions whose lengths are controlled by apyrase-mediated substrate degradation. With this scheme, we synthesize DNA strands carrying 144 bits, including addressing, and demonstrate retrieval with streaming nanopore sequencing. We further devise a digital codec to reduce requirements for synthesis accuracy and sequencing coverage, and experimentally show robust data retrieval from imperfectly synthesized strands. This work provides distributive enzymatic synthesis and information-theoretic approaches to advance digital information storage in DNA. Adoption of DNA as a data storage medium could be accelerated with specialized synthesis processes and codecs. The authors describe TdT-mediated DNA synthesis in which data is stored in transitions between non-identical nucleotides and the use of synchronization markers to provide error tolerance.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">To develop active nanomaterials that can instantly respond to external stimuli with designed mechanical motions is an important step towards the realization of nanorobots. Herein, we present our finding of a versatile working mechanism that allows instantaneous change of alignment direction and speed of semiconductor nanowires in an external electric field with simple visible-light exposure. The light induced alignment switch can be cycled over hundreds of times and programmed to express words in Morse code. With theoretical analysis and simulation, the working principle can be attributed to the optically tuned real-part (in-phase) electrical polarization of a semiconductor nanowire in aqueous suspension. The manipulation principle is exploited to create a new type of microscale stepper motor that can readily switch between in-phase and out-phase modes, and agilely operate independent of neighboring motors with patterned light. This work could inspire the development of new types of micro/nanomachines with individual and reconfigurable maneuverability for many applications. Developing active nanomaterials that can instantly respond to external stimuli with designed mechanical motions for nanorobotics applications remains a challenge. Here, the authors propose a Si-NWs light programmable nanomotors design based on optically tunable in-phase electric polarization.</font>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">Social media like Facebook are harshly criticized for the propagation of health misinformation. Yet, little research has provided in-depth analysis of real-world data to measure the extent to which Internet users engage with it. This article examines 6.5 million interactions generated by 500 posts on an emblematic case of online health misinformation: the Facebook page Santé + Mag, which generates five times more interactions than the combination of the five best-established French media outlets. Based on the literature on cultural evolution, we tested whether the presence of cognitive factors of attraction, that tap into evolved cognitive preferences, such as information related to sexuality, social relations, threat, disgust or negative emotions, could explain the success of Santé + Mag’s posts. Drawing from media studies findings, we hypothesized that their popularity could be driven by Internet users’ desire to interact with their friends and family by sharing phatic posts (i.e. statements with no practical information fulfilling a social function such as “hello” or “sister, I love you”). We found that phatic posts were the strongest predictor of interactions, followed by posts with a positive emotional valence. While 50% of the posts were related to social relations, only 28% consisted of health misinformation. Despite its cognitive appeal, health misinformation was a negative predictor of interactions. Sexual content negatively predicted interactions and other factors of attraction such as disgust, threat or negative emotions did not predict interactions. These results strengthen the idea that Facebook is first and foremost a social network used by people to foster their social relations, not to spread online misinformation. We encourage researchers working on misinformation to conduct finer-grained analysis of online content and to adopt interdisciplinary approach to study the phatic dimension of communication, together with positive content, to better understand the cultural evolution dynamics of social media.</font>
