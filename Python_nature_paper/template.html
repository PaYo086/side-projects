            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <font size="4">Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has emerged as a potential treatment for severe colitis associated with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) following hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Bacterial engraftment from FMT donor to recipient has been reported, however the fate of fungi and viruses after FMT remains unclear. Here we report longitudinal dynamics of the gut bacteriome, mycobiome and virome in a teenager with GvHD after receiving four doses of FMT at weekly interval. After serial FMTs, the gut bacteriome, mycobiome and virome of the patient differ from compositions before FMT with variable temporal dynamics. Diversity of the gut bacterial community increases after each FMT. Gut fungal community initially shows expansion of several species followed by a decrease in diversity after multiple FMTs. In contrast, gut virome community varies substantially over time with a stable rise in diversity. The bacterium, Corynebacterium jeikeium, and Torque teno viruses, decrease after FMTs in parallel with an increase in the relative abundance of Caudovirales bacteriophages. Collectively, FMT may simultaneously impact on the various components of the gut microbiome with distinct effects.</font>
